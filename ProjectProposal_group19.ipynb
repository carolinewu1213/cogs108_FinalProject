    "In this project, we aim to investigate the correlation between the Body Mass Index (BMI) of diabetic individuals and their health insurance claim amounts. Insurance claim analysis helps insurance companies to detect fraud claims and predict future claims and risks. Moreover, by monitoring the historical claim data, insurance companies can create new insurance products to conform to new trends that are detected from the claim data to maximize company profits. In healthcare, there are various health factors and demographic factors that affect the claim amounts of an individual's health insurance, therefore, various customized health insurance plans are created by insurance companies to satisfy customers’ demands and optimize companies’ profits. \n",
    "The claim amount represents the sum of money that the insurance company pays to the beneficiary when the insurance reaches its maturity. Health insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for a portion of an individual's medical expenses. The extent of coverage provided by health insurance is determined by the specific conditions in the policy, governing the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed by the insurance company. When assessing an individual's eligibility for health-related insurance, insurance companies take various factors into consideration. One of these factors is Body Mass Index (BMI), which helps determine the person's risk of developing health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. In accordance with the weight status categories defined by BMI, individuals with a BMI falling between 25 and 29.9 are categorized as overweight, while those with a BMI exceeding 30 are classified as obese. Increased rates of higher BMI have emerged as a major contributing factor to the growing incidence of diabetes<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). Diabetes is a costly chronic disease  occurs when the pancreas fails to produce sufficient insulin or when the body is unable to effectively utilize the insulin it generates<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#cite_note-2). In a study conducted by Khan et al., it was found that individuals who have been diagnosed with diabetes tend to spend $8941 more on medical expenses compared to those who do not have a diabetes diagnosis. Furthermore, the study observed that the compounded annual growth rate in per capita annual medical expenditures was approximately 9\\% higher among individuals with diabetes<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#cite_note-3). Evidence from Finkelstein et al. suggested obesity-related medical expenditures takes up 9.1 percent of total annual cost<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#cite_note-4). Due to the elevated health risks associated with higher BMI values, individuals with diabetes who also have higher BMI tend to have higher medical expenditures compared with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies focused on analyzing the relationship between diabetic status and medical expenditures, hoping to highlight the positive correlation between diabetes and the economic burden placed on them. In our study, we try to step further to investigate the possible correlation of the BMI of diabetics individuals with regard to the health insurance claim amounts. \n",

By merging these datasets, the overall data volume is increased, thereby enhancing the precision of correlation analysis and similar analytical procedures. The combined dataset encompasses the following variables: index, PatientID, age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, diabetic status, number of children, smoking status, region, and claim amount. Our current analysis aims to assess the relevance of all these variables in relation to our primary research objective, which focuses on determining the impact of various factors on insurance claims. Consequently, we are conducting a meticulous evaluation of the inclusion of certain variables, such as smoker status and region, as they may not directly contribute to our focused investigation."
